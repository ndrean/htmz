# HTMZ

It displays a grocery list where you can view the details of each product. It holds the price.
You can select a product to add to the shopping list. A total number of items gets updated.
In the shopping cart, you can increase/decrease the quantity and remove the item. The total value is calculated.

- `SQLite` with filed-based storage
- HashMap to hold the users' shopping cart
- WebSocket to remove the shopping cart when disconnects

## HTMX Cart Update Flow

This diagram shows how cart operations trigger real-time updates for both cart count and total:

### Scenario 1: Adding Item from Grocery List

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    participant CartTotal as Cart Total Element

    User->>Browser: Clicks "Add to Cart" button
    Browser->>Server: POST /api/cart/add/42
    Server->>Server: Add item to user's cart
    Server-->>Browser: 200 OK + HX-Trigger: updateCartCount, cartUpdate
    Browser->>Browser: Fires 'updateCartCount' event
    Browser->>Browser: Fires 'cartUpdate' event
    Browser->>Server: GET /cart-count (triggered by updateCartCount)
    Server-->>Browser: "3" (new cart count)
    Browser->>Browser: Updates cart badge to "3"
    CartTotal->>Server: GET /cart-total (hx-trigger="cartUpdate from:body")
    Server-->>CartTotal: "$15.50" (new total)
    Browser->>Browser: Updates cart total display
```

### Scenario 2: Changing Quantity in Shopping Cart

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    participant CartTotal as Cart Total Element

    User->>Browser: Clicks "+" button on cart item
    Browser->>Server: POST /api/cart/increase-quantity/42
    Server->>Server: Increment item quantity
    Server-->>Browser: 200 OK + "2" + HX-Trigger: updateCartCount, cartUpdate
    Browser->>Browser: Updates quantity display to "2"
    Browser->>Browser: Fires 'updateCartCount' event
    Browser->>Browser: Fires 'cartUpdate' event
    Browser->>Server: GET /cart-count (triggered by updateCartCount)
    Server-->>Browser: "4" (new cart count)
    Browser->>Browser: Updates cart badge to "4"
    CartTotal->>Server: GET /cart-total (hx-trigger="cartUpdate from:body")
    Server-->>CartTotal: "$20.50" (new total)
    Browser->>Browser: Updates cart total display
```

**Key HTMX Concepts:**

- `hx-trigger="load, cartUpdate from:body"` - Element listens for events
- `HX-Trigger: cartUpdate` header - Server tells browser to fire events

## Setup assets

Copy the `.gz` versions of _index.html_, _index.css_, _htmx.min.js_ and _ws.min.js_  into "/public",
and symlink the SVGs from src/html/svg into public/svg

```sh
pnpm --filter htmz update --recursive
```

```sh
pnpm --filter htmz make:public
ln -s src/html/svg public/svg
```


## Memory leak detection

Memory leak detection on in Debug mode with `std.posix.sigaction` (cf [this example](https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig/blob/master/examples/09_shutdown.zig)).

### Memory Monitoring Commands Local Development

```sh
# Get process ID and initial memory baseline
SERVER_PID=$(pgrep -f 'zig-out/bin/htmz')
ps -o pid,vsz,rss,comm -p $SERVER_PID

# Monitor memory during stress test
ps -o pid,vsz,rss,comm -p $SERVER_PID && date
```

### Run failure stress test to check memory behavior

```sh
k6 run load-test/failure-test.js
```

### VPS memory monitor

```sh
# Get process ID and initial memory baseline (adjust path for VPS)
cd opt/htmz
SERVER_PID=$(pgrep -f 'htmz')
ps -o pid,vsz,rss,comm -p $SERVER_PID

# Alternative if pgrep fails - find by process name
SERVER_PID=$(ps aux | grep '[h]tmz' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
ps -o pid,vsz,rss,comm -p $SERVER_PID

# Monitor memory during stress test
ps -o pid,vsz,rss,comm -p $SERVER_PID && date

# Check memory usage from /proc (more detailed)
cat /proc/$SERVER_PID/status | grep -E 'VmRSS|VmSize'
```

## Deploy on `Hetzner`

CX22 machine, 2 VCPU x86, 4GB RAM machine with `Debian`.
  
- Static assets (HTML, CSS, SVG, HTMX.JS) are compiled into the code.
- The `SVG`s are saved as text into the SQLite database, and then fetched and interpolated as text into the rendered template.

Production built:

```sh
# build with target
zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-linux-gnu -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

- copy local binaries and assets to the VPS

```sh
scp ./zig-out/bin/htmz root@ipv4-address:opt/htmz/htmz-httpz

# the SVGs are saved in the /public/ssvsg folder. SQLite fills its "items" table with the SVGs as text.
scp -r public/ root@ipv4-address:opt/htmz/
```

In the VPS, test:

```sh
root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ cd opt/htmz && chmod +x htmz-httpz

root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ SECRET_KEY=ziggit ./htmz-httpz
```

- hammer the VPS from home: the `httpz` server is listening on port 8880 (to be `Cloudflare` compatible).

```sh
BASE_URL=http://ipv4-address:8880 k6 run load-test/progressive-test.js 
```

### Daemonize - Create service

```sh
root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ 


sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/htmz-httpz.service > /dev/null << 'EOF'
[Unit]
  Description=HTMZ Web Server (httpz implementation)
  After=network.target

[Service]
  Type=simple
  User=root
  WorkingDirectory=/root/opt/htmz
  Environment=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/root/opt/htmz/lib
  Environment=SECRET_KEY=ziggit
  ExecStart=/root/opt/htmz/htmz-httpz
  Restart=always
  # Set file descriptor limits
  LimitNOFILE=65536
  LimitNPROC=65536

[Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Start/stop the servce:

```sh
root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# auto-start on boot
root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ sudo systemctl enable htmz-httpz

root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ sudo systemctl start htmz-httpz
root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ sudo systemctl status htmz-httpz

root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ sudo systemctl stop htmz-httpz
root@debian-4gb-nbg1-1:~ sudo systemctl restart htmz-httpz
```

Logs:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u htmz-httpz -f   # Live logs
sudo journalctl -u htmz-httpz      # All logs
```

Check if the server is running: <https://httpz.htmz.online>

## Notes

`-v` lets you inspect the headers so you can see when cookies are being set and sent.

- grab a cookie for testing:

```sh
curl -v --cookie-jar cookies.txt http://localhost:8080/
```

(or `-v -c`)

- pass the cookie for testing a POST endpoint:

```sh
curl -v --cookie cookies.txt -X POST http://91.98.129.192:8080/api/cart/add/1
```

(or `-v -b`)

- Useful!:

```sh
pkill -f "htmz"

pgrep -f htmz
# <pid> 
lsof -it:8880 | xargs kill <pid>
```
